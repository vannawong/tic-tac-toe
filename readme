This file will keep track of goals for the project, and any other useful information.

You'll probably want to start with reading up on JavaFX.  For now, you can run the Main class - see that it creates
a blank canvas, and play around with it.

Important:
To get into the practice of using git, and to make sure we don't make project breaking changes, be sure to use
git branch -b *new branch name*
before you make any changes.  Also be sure to pull and merge from master occasionally.

For example, I want to create a new branch, so I can make changes to the game window.
First, I will start from the master branch, and pull from master using this command:
git checkout master
git pull
Then, I will branch from master, onto a new branch with a helpful name:
git branch -b create-game-window

When I've made my changes, I will commit and then push my new branch to git:
git add .
git commit -m "Added 2 buttons"
git push -u origin create-game-window

Note that you will only need to use -u once.  Once the branch has been pushed to origin (the github repo), you will only
need to do
git push
